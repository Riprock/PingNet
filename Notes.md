##TODO
   - Make the command system argument based instead of "menu" based
   - Start working on the beacon
   - Setup multiple ways to send the comands. So either all in one ping or across multple pings
   - Going to fork to create another process b/c I need another process for hading the sniffing for heartbeat and cmd pings
   - Maybe add file transfer capabilites.
